		Deep down inside, what is important to you? What do you want your life to stand for?  

		Personal values are principles and beliefs we have about how we want to live our life and what kind of person we want to be. Values are directions we keep moving in. Values are an ongoing process. For example, if you want to be a loving, caring, supportive partner, that is a value – an ongoing process.  

		% Use this diagram to help you look at your personal values. In each blank circle, fill in a value you hold. You do not have to use every circle, and you may add more circles as needed. For help thinking about your values, take a look at the questions on the next page. 

		The following are areas of life that are valued by some people. Not everyone has the same values, and this is not a test to see whether you have the “correct” values. There may be certain areas that you don’t value much; you may skip them if you wish.

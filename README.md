# MBRP-RA booklet

This repository contains re-formatted content from C. Roos & al: *A Clinician's Guide to Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention â€” Rolling Admission (MBRP-RA)* (pages 105â€“160) and translations:

- [English PDF](https://github.com/eudoxos/MBRP-RA-booklet/blob/pdf/mmbrpra-en.pdf?raw=True)
- [Czech PDF](https://github.com/eudoxos/MBRP-RA-booklet/blob/pdf/mmbrpra-cs.pdf?raw=True)

A few adaptations were done:

- Separation of reading content and handouts:
	- all sessions are meant to be printed as a single booklet, and given to participants when they first come;
	- handouts on the last few pages (marked with the ðŸ–‰ symbol) are to be be given out as separate sheets for writing into.
- Addition of the sections *Basic Feelings/Needs We All Have* from [Non-Violent Communication website](https://www.nonviolentcommunication.com/learn-nonviolent-communication/feelings/)
- Wording was adjusted slightly in Session 7 where the values diagram handout was split off the values text.
- The *Starter Kit* is not included; for the Czech version, it was put on https://brzdime.cz/start; the regular meetings take place online, and the first contact is always through the website.

The formatting was originally created for the Czech translation (https://brzdime.cz). The English text was now put back into the LaTeX skeleton. The hope is that other translations may use the structure to avoid the tedious formatting work, producing a localized and good-looking booklet with relative ease. Ask your local LaTeX expert for help.

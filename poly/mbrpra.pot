msgid "It is common and totally okay to feel restless while practicing. This can be a physical restlessness and/or a mental restlessness. See what it’s like to notice the restlessness with a sense of curiosity (\\toSelf{Hmm, what does this actually feel like?}), rather than judging yourself or trying to force the restlessness to go away. You can also mix in mindful walking and mindful movement into your practice, instead of only practices where you sit still."

Try to gently acknowledge these thoughts with a sense of curiosity and kindness. (\\toSelf{Oh, look at that, there’s that doubt coming up again}). Keep in mind that there is no such thing as doing a practice “right” or “wrong.” There is simply doing a practice and seeing what comes up for you. If your mind wanders a lot or you have difficulty focusing, that is totally okay and normal."

msgid "When we practice, it is common to feel a desire to feel better or to judge ourselves for how we feel. See if you can pause and acknowledge that desire to feel different (\\toSelf{Oh wow, look at that, I am putting pressure on myself to feel different than how I feel}). See what it’s like to give yourself permission to just feel the way you are feeling in the moment. Mindfulness practice involves bringing a sense of acceptance towards our experience, instead of pressuring ourselves to feel better or different."

msgid "It is completely normal and okay to forget to practice and to have times when you are busy or get sidetracked from your practice. This happens to all us. Even if you have missed several days or weeks of practice, you can always get back on track at any time and start practicing again. The key is to commit to regular practice for the long-run and to keep coming back to your practice again and again. Remember that you don’t need to take huge chunks out of your day to practice mindfulness. Just 5 or 10 minutes of practice a day, goes a long way! Doing little bits of practice each day is like giving your brain a little “recharge” each day, which keep your brain strong and healthy. You can also set an “alarm” on your smartphone to remind you to practice."

msgid "even as adults. We are not simply born with one brain that stay the same all of our lives. Rather, our brain is constantly changing depending on what experiences we have and what information and skills we learn about and practice. Whenever we learn or practice something new, like a skill, new connections are formed in the brain. The more and more we practice a skill, the stronger these connections become. The fancy word to describe changes in the brain is called neuroplasticity."

Research shows that regular practice of mindfulness actually changes people brains and strengthens the areas of the brain involved in managing stress and emotions. These studies also show that people’s stress levels go down with regular practice of mindfulness."
